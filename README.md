# Drawscript

This is the Drawscript Application which will be live at [*Drawscript*](http://drawscript.com)

Drawscript is a totally new form of written language. It is a user-defined, user-identified database of arch-symbols that will begin to build a community of new word-forms. The goal is to create a new language that bridges the gap between cultural boundaries and the computer-user relationship. 

Currently, the database consists of scanned versions of the characters. They will be converted to vectors, as well as bitmap and to a form of QR-Codes in order to convert them to binary which will allow the computer to understand them as well.
