# Drawscript

This is the Drawscript Application which will be live at [*Drawscript*](http://drawscript.com)

Drawscript is a database of hieroglyphic, architectural symbols that are definable. The symbols do not have meanings until users sign up and assign the meanings they want to the symbol of their choosing. 

Drawscript is a totally new form of written language. It is a user-defined, user-identified database of symbols that will build a community of new word-forms. The goal is to create a new language that bridges the gap between cultural boundaries as well as the computer-user relationship. 

Currently, the database consists of scanned versions of the characters. They will be converted to vectors, as well as bitmap and to a form of QR-Codes in order to convert them to binary which will allow the computer to understand them as well.
